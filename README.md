# London-Airport-Analysis
This is a visualisation project that was made using Tableau. The open source airport dataset that I have used for this project has been downloaded from the London Datastore. The Dataset consists of various excel sheets. For this project, I have used the data from International Passengers by Country, Total Passengers, London Passenger routes sheets. The dataset consists of data from the Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, London City, Luton, Southend airports. To create flight paths I used the International Passengers by Country data. However, the data did not have the origin and destination latitudes and longitudes. I have manually added the latitudes and longitudes of different london airports to make paths from each of the London Airports. 
The results of the analysis shows that:
1) Very few international flights operate from the Southend Airport.
2) The passenger count of the Southend Airport is also very low.
3) Heathrow airport has had the highest passenger count over the years (2004 to 2014), followed by Gatwick and Stansted.
4) The number of passengers/ travellers to the Heathrow airport has increased by almost 6000000 from 2004 to 2014.
5) Largest number of passengers arriving and departing in London come from the USA. Following the USA, large number of passengers come from Spain and Italy.
